    /// <summary>
    ///     Advanced interface for making complex changes during a level shift operation.
    ///     Justification for ILevelShiftAdjuster interface:
    ///     The ShiftBranchLevels method works very well if the structure
    ///     of all branches below the given object have the same branching
    ///     structure. However, this is an idealized situation. The intent
    ///     of ShiftBranchLevels is to make it easy to add and remove multiple
    ///     levels of header groups over the same set of data. For the 'Basic Sample'
    ///     data shown below, the 'Real' nodes are the actual data, and the rest
    ///     of the nodes are headers. If the goal is to remove the Type 2 headers for
    ///     this tree, then a ShiftBranchLevels(Depth = 1, Remove = 2, Insert = 1)
    ///     will collapse the type 2 headers and create once set of Type3 headers while
    ///     maintaining the sub expansion states of the Type3 Header nodes.
    ///     *****Basic Sample*****
    ///     FirstType1Header
    ///     FirstType2Header
    ///     SecondType2Header
    ///     FirstType3Header
    ///     RealNodeX
    ///     SecondType1Header
    ///     FirstType2Header
    ///     FirstType3Header
    ///     RealNodeZ
    ///     SecondType2Header
    ///     FirstType3Header
    ///     SecondType3Header
    ///     RealNodeW
    ///     The advanced sample shown below is a less idealized state. There are
    ///     two concepts added here:
    ///     1) A SubSet node is inserted between branching levels. In this branch,
    ///     removing Type2 headers requires operating on a depth 2 levels from the
    ///     top, not the requested one. Level shifting should provide an easy mechanism
    ///     to skip the subset node altogether while it walks down to the desired depth,
    ///     or to adjust the depth (plus or minus) that insert and remove operations
    ///     should take place at. For example, the SubSetNode would increase the Depth
    ///     for this part of the tree by one level.
    ///     2) The Type2NeutralRealNodeY represents real data that cannot be categorized
    ///     under any of the headers at this level. The 'Remove 2 levels and insert 1'
    ///     at this point would blow away any expansion on this node. However, when the
    ///     Type3 headers are put back in place, this item will fit naturally at either
    ///     the Type3 header level, or underneath one of the Type3 headers from the replacement
    ///     list. In other words, the branch coming off of Type2NeutralRealNodeY should be treated
    ///     the same as the branches at the depth specified at shift branch levels. These branches
    ///     are collected then reattached at the appropriate level using IBranch.LocateExpandedList.
    ///     There needs to be a way to place the RealNodeY branch into this 'reattach' list.
    ///     *****Advanced Sample*****
    ///     FirstType1Header
    ///     SubSetNode
    ///     FirstType2Header
    ///     SecondType2Header
    ///     FirstType3Header
    ///     RealNodeX
    ///     SecondType1Header
    ///     Type2NeutralRealNodeY
    ///     RealNodeYChild1
