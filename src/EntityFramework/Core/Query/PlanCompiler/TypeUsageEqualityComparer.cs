    // This class is used as a Comparer for Types all through the PlanCompiler.

    // to equality of the "Identity" of the Type (not the TypeUsage).
    // NOTE: Unlike other parts of the query pipeline, record types follow
    // a much stricter equality condition here - the field names must be the same, and
    // the field types must be equal.
    // NOTE: Primitive types are considered equal, if their Identities are equal. This doesn't
    // take into account any of the facets that are represented external to the type (size, for instance).
    // Again, this is different from other parts of  the query pipeline; and we're much stricter here
